Hey Fil,

1.We made a cheatcode for turning off collision for you, simply press the j key and you will turn off death.

2.Also if you die in normal mode, please use F5 to refreash instead of spacebar as the bullets seem to 
increase when you use spacebar (we are working on this bug currently)

3.talk to the shopkeep after everylevel(end state is also there when you beat game)

4.UI uses buttons instead of mousepress as the whole game uses only keyboard, other screens will be added 
to beta once design is perfected.

5.The levels ARE beatable (I've made sure BUUT its really hard so if youd like to beat it, heads up, itll take a while)
